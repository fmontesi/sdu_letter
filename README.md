# SDU letters in LaTeX

A template for writing an official SDU letter in LaTeX.

Saves Fabrizio (and you?) the frustration of scanning reference letters and the like.

If you make improvements that you think may be useful to others using this, please send them to me! (Preferably, make a pull request here on GitHub, but I will try to be lenient if you are a colleague from IMADA.)

# Instructions

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/fmontesi/sdu_letter.git` .
- Add an image file named `signature.png` with your real-world signature, in the same directory of the downloaded repository.
- Edit `main.tex`.
- Compile! You now have a letter.
